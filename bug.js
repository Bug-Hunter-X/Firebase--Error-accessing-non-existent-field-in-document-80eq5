The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a field in a document that doesn't exist. For example, if you have a document with a structure like this:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
```
And you try to access the field `city` like this:
```javascript
const city = doc.data().city;
```
Then you will get an error. This is because the `city` field does not exist in the document. To avoid this error, you can check if the field exists before accessing it. For example:
```javascript
const city = doc.data().city || null;
```
This will set `city` to `null` if the field does not exist. Another option is to use the optional chaining operator (?.) if you are using a newer version of Javascript
```javascript
const city = doc.data()?.city;
```
